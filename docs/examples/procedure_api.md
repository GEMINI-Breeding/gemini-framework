# Procedure API Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Procedure API in the Gemini framework.

## Source File Location

The original Python script is located at `gemini/examples/api/procedure_api.py`.

## Code

```python
from gemini.api.procedure import Procedure

# Create a new procedure
procedure = Procedure.create(
    procedure_name="Procedure Test 1",
    procedure_info={"test": "test"},
)
print(f"Created Procedure: {procedure}")

# Get Procedure with procedure_name
procedure = Procedure.get(
    procedure_name=procedure.procedure_name,
)
print(f"Got Procedure: {procedure}")

# Get Procedure by ID
procedure_by_id = Procedure.get_by_id(procedure.id)
print(f"Got Procedure by ID: {procedure_by_id}")

# Get all procedures
all_procedures = Procedure.get_all()
print(f"All Procedures:")
for proc in all_procedures:
    print(proc)

# Search for procedures
searched_procedures = Procedure.search(procedure_name="Procedure Test 1")
length_searched_procedures = len(searched_procedures)
print(f"Found {length_searched_procedures} procedures with procedure_name 'Procedure Test 1'")


# Refresh the procedure
procedure.refresh()
print(f"Refreshed Procedure: {procedure}")

# Update the procedure
procedure.update(
    procedure_info={"test": "test_updated"},
)
print(f"Updated Procedure: {procedure}")

# Set Procedure Info
procedure.set_info(
    procedure_info={"test": "test_set"},
)
print(f"Set Procedure Info: {procedure.get_info()}")

# Check if procedure exists before deletion
exists = Procedure.exists(
    procedure_name="Procedure Test 1",
)
print(f"Procedure exists: {exists}")

# Delete the created procedure
is_deleted = procedure.delete()
print(f"Deleted Procedure: {is_deleted}")

# Check if procedure exists after deletion
exists_after_deletion = Procedure.exists(
    procedure_name="Procedure Test 1",
)
print(f"Procedure exists after deletion: {exists_after_deletion}")
```

## Explanation

This example demonstrates the basic operations for managing procedures using the Gemini API:

*   **Creating a procedure:** The `Procedure.create()` method is used to create a new procedure with a name and additional information.
*   **Getting a procedure:** The `Procedure.get()` method retrieves a procedure by its name. The `Procedure.get_by_id()` method retrieves a procedure by its unique ID.
*   **Getting all procedures:** The `Procedure.get_all()` method retrieves all procedures in the database.
*   **Searching for procedures:** The `Procedure.search()` method finds procedures based on specified criteria, such as the name.
*   **Refreshing a procedure:** The `Procedure.refresh()` method updates the procedure object with the latest data from the database.
*   **Updating a procedure:** The `Procedure.update()` method updates the attributes of an existing procedure.
*   **Setting procedure information:** The `Procedure.set_info()` method updates the `procedure_info` field with new data.
*   **Checking for existence:** The `Procedure.exists()` method verifies if a procedure with the given name exists.
*   **Deleting a procedure:** The `Procedure.delete()` method removes the procedure from the database.
