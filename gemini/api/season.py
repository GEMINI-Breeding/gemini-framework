"""
This module defines the Season class, which represents a season entity, including its metadata, associations to experiments, and related operations.

It includes methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting seasons, as well as methods for checking existence, searching, and managing associations with experiments.

This module includes the following methods:

- `exists`: Check if a season with the given name and experiment exists.
- `create`: Create a new season.
- `get`: Retrieve a season by its name and experiment.
- `get_by_id`: Retrieve a season by its ID.
- `get_all`: Retrieve all seasons.
- `search`: Search for seasons based on various criteria.
- `update`: Update the details of a season.
- `delete`: Delete a season.
- `refresh`: Refresh the season's data from the database.
- `get_info`: Get the additional information of the season.
- `set_info`: Set the additional information of the season.
- Association methods for experiments.
